# Policy Engines for Platform Governance

This section covers admission control as the place where a platform enforces policy. It explains where admission sits in a request, Pod Security Admission and validating admission policy, and admission webhooks with their failure behavior and exceptions.

The section has one module. It has a playground, a graded lab and a capstone lab on a local kind cluster, and ends with a knowledge check. Each part is followed by the lab that practises it, and the module ends with a summary.

## Learning Outcomes

- Place admission in the request path and tell it apart from authorization
- Enforce a Pod Security level with namespace labels
- Write a validating admission policy and a binding with the right action and scope
- Explain how failure policy, selectors and exceptions decide real coverage
- Test a rule with a server-side dry run
